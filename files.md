# Files

Every record is one file with one writer. Headers are `key: value` lines, then a blank line, then the body. Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`, local time. Folder names are the same at every level: `state/`, `inbox/`, `tasks/` and `log/` exist per project, per environment and at the root of `user/` for the executive roles.

Layout inside the mind, all generated, all under `user/` (git-ignored):

```
user/
  VERSION                     base version this user/ was created or migrated with
  preferences.md              global preferences
  routes.md                   environments, projects and other minds, names only
  machines/<host>.md          one per machine
  knowledge/                  private modules, same format as the base ones
  protocols/<name>.md         user-defined protocols, one file per protocol
  state/ inbox/ tasks/ log/   executive roles (overseer, technician, genesis)
  envs/<env>/
    state/ inbox/ tasks/ log/
  projects/<project>/
    brief.md
    preferences.md            project preferences (optional)
    state/ inbox/ tasks/ log/
```

Team state, in the repo, on the `hivem1nd` branch mounted at `.hivem1nd/state/` (ignored by the code branches):

```
.hivem1nd/                    committed in main: config and overrides
  config.md
  roles/ features/ preferences.md   optional overrides
  state/                      the worktree of the hivem1nd branch
    presence/ inbox/ tasks/ log/
```

## State: `state/<unit>.md`

```markdown
unit: executor-myapp
state: out
machine: SCOUT
branch: feat/login
commit: 3f2a9c1
tree: clean
date: 2026-09-15 14:02
claims: src/auth/, docs/auth.md

Login form done and tested in the browser. Password reset half done: the mail template is missing. Next: finish the template, then task 004. Do not re-ask: sessions stay in cookies, decided on 09-14.
```

`state` is `in` or `out`. `tree` is `clean` or the output of `git status --porcelain` in one line. `claims` only in team repos. The body is the context, ten lines at most.

## Message: `inbox/<to>/<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>-<from>.md`

```markdown
from: overlord-web@SCOUT
to: executor-myapp
date: 2026-09-15 14:02
subject: task 003 is ready

Task 003 in tasks/. It depends on 002, already closed. Start when the current one is done.
```

One folder per recipient. The recipient deletes the file at its exit, once read. A second message to the same recipient in the same minute appends -2, then -3, to the file name. A message is context, never authorization.

## Task: `tasks/<id>-<slug>.md`

```markdown
id: 003
status: open
from: overseer
to: executor-myapp
date: 2026-09-15 13:40
depends: 002
design: docs/design.md

## Request
Add password reset. Files: src/auth/reset.ts (new), src/auth/routes.ts. Do not touch src/auth/session.ts. Done means: a user receives the mail, the link opens the form, the new password works, all three seen in the browser.

## Report
```

`id` is sequential per project, three digits. `status` moves from `open` to `done` when the executor appends the report, and to `closed` when the requester verifies it. That change is the event hooks listen to. `depends` and `design` are optional; `design` comes from the brief.

## Brief: `projects/<project>/brief.md`

```markdown
project: myapp
env: web
stack: Next.js 15, MySQL 8
run: npm run dev
build: npm run build
design: docs/design.md
repo: github.com/user/myapp

## Facts
- 2026-09-12: the blog is stored in MySQL and edited from /admin; the JSON files are gone.
- 2026-09-14: sessions stay in cookies; no JWT.
```

No paths. Paths are per machine and live in the machine file. The first role that enters a project without a brief writes the header from its audit and asks only what the audit could not answer.

## Log: `log/<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>-<unit>.md`

```markdown
unit: executor-myapp
date: 2026-09-15 14:02
branch: feat/login
commits: 3f2a9c1..8b1d044
task: 003

Added the reset flow in src/auth/reset.ts and its route. The mail template is a plain-text stub, to be replaced. Verify: request a reset from /login, open the link from the console output, set a new password, log in.
```

One entry per piece of work, written on exit. Nothing loads it by default; it is read on request.

## Routes: `routes.md`

```markdown
## Environments
- web: myapp, shop
- unity: vigilum

## Projects
- myapp (web)
- shop (web)
- vigilum (unity)
- tool

## Minds
- D:\team-mind
```

Names only. `Minds` lists other minds this one can read, when there are any.

## Machine: `machines/<host>.md`

```markdown
machine: SCOUT
mind: D:\mind
language: en
preferences-first: yes
update-check: daily
last-check: 2026-09-15
setup: done

## Agents
- claude-code: on-demand
- cursor: auto

## Paths
- web: C:\Users\me\GitHub
- myapp: C:\Users\me\GitHub\myapp
- vigilum: C:\Users\me\Unity\vigilum

## Excluded
- knowledge
- corpo
```

`setup` is `done` or the number of the next step, so any front resumes. `preferences-first` is `yes` by default; `no` puts the HIVEM1ND auto rule before existing preferences while preserving their content. `update-check` is `daily` or `off`. `Excluded` lists the modules and features left out at setup; `/evolve` never installs them.

While `setup` is a number, a temporary `## Setup Draft` section contains a fenced JSON block with the answers collected so far. Every front preserves it when resuming. The section is removed when `setup: done`; completed settings remain in the header and the Agents, Paths and Excluded sections.

The `## Managed Files` section contains a fenced JSON object mapping installed absolute file paths to their SHA-256 content hashes. Setup and updates replace a managed file automatically only while its content still matches the recorded hash. An unowned or locally modified file requires a keep-or-replace choice. Paths and hashes stay private in the machine record.

## Preferences: `preferences.md`

```markdown
- 2026-09-11: answers of one or two lines, no offers or agendas. Why: long blocks are noise.
- 2026-09-15: public text impersonal, no "you". Why: reads like an installer.
```

One line per preference, with the date and the reason. The global file applies everywhere; a project file applies to that project and overrides the global one.

## Protocol: `protocols/<name>.md`

```markdown
name: nightly-build
purpose: Build and smoke test the app before the team starts.
trigger: schedule, weekdays 07:00
repeat: every 1 day
inputs: repo C:\Users\me\GitHub\myapp, branch main
stop: three failures in a row
report: pass or fail per step, and the final build path

## Steps

1. Pull the latest commit on main.
   Task: `git pull origin main` in the repo path.
   Time: 2 minutes; abort the run if it does not finish in time.
   Result: `git log -1` shows a commit dated today.

2. Build.
   Task: `npm run build` in the repo path.
   Time: 10 minutes; abort the run if it does not finish in time.
   Result: `dist/` exists and the command exits 0.

3. Smoke test.
   Task: open the app and check the login screen loads.
   Time: 5 minutes.
   Result: the login screen is visible in the browser.
```

`name` is the file's own name in kebab-case. `trigger` is manual, a schedule or a condition. `repeat` is `once`, a count, `every <interval>` or `until <condition>`. `stop` lists the conditions that end the run besides a failed step. Each step's Task names the exact action, path, command or tool that performs it; Time is a duration, a deadline or a schedule, plus what happens when it is exceeded; Result is the outcome that proves the step is done, checkable by reading a file, an output or a state, never a vague "done". Steps run strictly in order; a run stops at the first step whose Result is not met and reports it against what was expected.

## Team config: `.hivem1nd/config.md`

```markdown
state: branch
ai-trailers: no
ai-files: yes
```

`state` is `branch` (default) or `main`. `ai-trailers` and `ai-files` are the AI presence setting, decided once per repo. Presence files in `state/presence/<user>-<unit>.md` have the same header as a state file plus `user:`.
